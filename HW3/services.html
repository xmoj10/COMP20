            <p> <strong> 4.25 out of 5 stars </strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mint tea was quite peculiar. I have to admit it, I didn't really enjoy the tea at first.
                However, after pairing this tea with a nice Dewick dinner of a chicken parm sandwich, I was able to cleanse
                my palette.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tea really shines when paired with something cold (I know... pairing a hot drink with something cold sounds funny).<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paired the tea with a big ol' bottle of chilled water and bam! insta-mint flavor.<br><br>
                Definitely a 10/10 recommended. <em> You have to try it..</em>

            <p> <strong> 4.5 out of 5 stars </strong><br>
                <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was by far my most favorite flavor. <br></em>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caught myself sneaking out some Chamomile packages like my friend does with her Dewick bananas.
                The chamomile flavor is subtle yet the aroma wafts through the air and envelopes you in a blanket of a seemingly soft felt blanket.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard this has received a <em>Doge Stamp of Approval &trade; </em><br> <br>
                I would recommend this very much.

            <p> <strong> 3.5 out of 5 stars </strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't even like breakfast. I don't even know why I tried this flavor. <br>
                Nonetheless, here it is. This tea had no unique characteristics. It reminded me of Lipton Tea but even that tasted better than this <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should state that my friend <em> did </em> recommend pairing this with tea but I didn't have the opportunity to try it again
                as the original tasting left me unmotivated to try it again.
