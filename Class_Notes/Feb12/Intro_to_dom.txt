Random number - Math.random()
    returns a value between 0 - 1
    should multiply to obtain larger number
    ex. C++ typically seeds using time as it always changes

    n = Math.random() * 9 + 1       ~ returns val between 0 - 10

An event only executes code when an "event" occurs
    ex. events = key click, a page loaded, a window resized

document.form1.num1.value = can use with "with" function
document.getElementByID   = if elem doesn't exist, returns NULL
